# Flood-Mapping-Pakistan-Case
Visualization and Analysis of Pakistan Floods 2022 Using Earth Engine and Geemap.

## Introduction
From 14 June to October 2022, floods in Pakistan killed 1,739 people, and caused 3.2 trillion Pakistani Rupees (14.9 billion US Dollars) of damage and 3.3 trillion Pakistani Rupees (15.2 billion US Dollars) of economic losses. The flooding was the world's deadliest flood since the 2020 South Asian floods and described as the worst in the country's history. On 25 August 2022, Pakistan declared a state of emergency because of the flooding. See the Wikipedia page for more information about the 2022 Pakistan floods.

## Requirements
To follow this tutorial, you must first [sign up](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) for a [Google Earth Engine account](https://earthengine.google.com/). Earth Engine is a cloud computing platform with a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. It is free for noncommercial use. To authenticate the Earth Engine Python API, see instructions [here](https://book.geemap.org/chapters/01_introduction.html#earth-engine-authentication).

In this tutorial, we will use the [geemap](https://geemap.org/) Python package to visualize and analyze the Pakistan floods. Geemap enables users to analyze and visualize Earth Engine datasets interactively within a Jupyter-based environment with minimal coding. To learn more about geemap, check out https://geemap.org.
